*In a sense, each of the different ways of getting involved that we
detail on this site are all ways of contributing to the Docker
community, which we define quite liberally: helping to make any aspect
of using Docker projects better for other people. This, of
course, includes things like filing and fixing bugs, but the discussion
on this page focuses on just some of the ways you can help have an
impact on the people part of that definition!*

# User Support

Working on Q & A is awesome for a number of reasons, one of which is the
simple act of helping others, and sharing in the camaraderie that comes
with being part of an open source project. Over time, the nicknames and
handles of strangers may come to be familiar mentors, mentees, and
friends.

Users look for help on the [user support forum](https://forum.docker.com)
and on the #Docker IRC channel on Freenode.

# Contributor Support

Contributors look for help on the [contributor support
forum](https://dev.dockerproject.org) on the beginning contributor chat
room on gitter and on the #Docker-dev IRC channel
on Freenode.


# Attend Conferences and Meetups

Whether at our own DockerCon, other open source, sysadmin, Linux, and
container events, or local meetups, getting out from behind your
monitor and into the same room with other community members can be a
great way to expand your horizons and refine your skills. At the same
time, these events are also an opportunity to have conversations that
breed inspiration, and forge relationships that foster collaboration.

# Speak At Conferences and Meetups

It's hard for all that other magic to happen at events if there's no one
to present any material. Demonstrating new techniques and technologies,
expounding on ideas big or small, or simply telling a good story are all
ways you can share your experience with the community. Even if you think
you have "nothing to talk about," or you haven't given a talk before,
coming up with an idea may be easier than you think. If you don't think
you're ready to speak at a big conference, try a local meetup or user
group first!

If you have prepared a presentation on Docker we would love to see it.
Please email us at contributions@dockerproject.org and tell us all about
it.

# Write and Share Documentation

All of the Docker projects have open source documentation. It's just
as easy to contribute to documentation as it is to contribute to code.
Fixing small mistakes such as typos and grammatical errors can be a
great way to introduce yourself to the workflow for contributing to open
source projects. There are plenty of ways to improve documentation for
Docker projects, ranging from editing API documentation to writing
tutorials to improving the contribution site itself! Read more about how
to contribute to documentation.
