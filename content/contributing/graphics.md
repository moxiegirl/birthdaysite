One area where open source projects traditionally lack is in the
visual and graphical expertise. Browsing github will demonstrate that
documentation and projects sorely lack good logos, illustrations and
other graphics help. If you have graphical talents, open source needs
them!

# What is a graphic

A graphic can be anything from a mascot for the project (like our Moby
Dock, contributed by a member of our community), or a diagram to make
the a concept more clear.

Here’s a list of suggestions:

* Finding new ways to improve the user experience
* Improving copy
* Choosing a better typeface
* Creating a logo
* Coming up with a new design/layout for components or even the entire application/site
* Coming up with alternative themes
* Critiquing the layout / flow


# How to write a graphic

Illustrations can be created in any application but should be released
along with the source file for that image. This could be a PSD, a AI, or
SVG file.

If the image is appropriate to place in a specific documentation page
then please add the image (+ source) to the documentation repo. 

If a graphic doesn’t have a clear home then please publish it under a
open source license or a creative commons license so that we can use it
in the project. Please post on the contribution forum a link to your
work so the entire community can benefit from it.
