Testing is about software quality, performance, reliability, or the usability. We develop and test Docker software before we release but we are human. We make mistakes, we get forgetful, or we just don't have enough time to do everything. 

You should test if you want to improve Docker software and processes. Testing is great for contributors that are experienced at software testing, usability, or who are otherwise great at spotting problems. 

# What can you test

If you write code, you might think of testing in terms of unit or integration tests. If you are interested in testing code, see <a href="HREF" target="_blank">how to run tests in our documentation</a>.

* Test our documentation by working through instructions
* Take an online usability test

# How to test code

There are lots of aspects to testing. You need to understand what parts of the Docker project are testable and then how to contribute testing to those parts.
