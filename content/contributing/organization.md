Help us organize our work by triaging. Triage is the process of reviewing
incoming issue tickets, gathering more information about the situation, and
verifying whether or not the issue is valid.

You should triage if you want to discover the Docker features other contributors
think is important. Triage is great for contributors that have an interest
or experience in software product management or project management.


# What do you triage?

The Docker projects use GitHub issues to record issues and feature requests that
come in from contributors. Contributors create new issues if they want to:

* report a problem they had with Docker software
* request a new feature 
* ask a question

# How do I triage?

Follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github account</a>.

2. Visit a Docker repository and press the **Watch** button.

	This tells GitHub to notify you of new issues. Depending on your settings,
	notification go to your GitHub or email inbox. Some of repositories you can watch are:

	<table class="tg">
		<tr>
			<td class="tg-031e"><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker" target="_blank">docker/docker</a></td>
			<td class="tg-031e">Docker the open-source application container engine</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="tg-031e"><a href="https://github.com/docker/machine" target="_blank">docker/machine</a></td>
			<td class="tg-031e">Software for the easy and quick creation of Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your own data center.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="tg-031e"><a href="https://github.com/docker/swarm" target="_blank">docker/swarm</a></td>
			<td class="tg-031e">Native clustering for Docker; manage several Docker hosts as a single, virtual host.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="tg-031e"><a href="https://github.com/docker/compose" target="_blank">docker/compose</a></td>
			<td class="tg-031e">Define and run complex applications using one or many interlinked containers.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	&nbsp;
	
	See <a href="https://github.com/docker" target="_blank">the complete list of
	Docker repositories</a> on GitHub.
	
3. Go to an open issue.

	You can filter issues on GitHub or you may get a notification.

4. Use <a
href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/project/ISSUE-TRIAGE.md"
target="_blank">the triage process</a> to triage the issue. 

	Triage is, in part, a discussion you have with the issue author. So, be polite
	and treat each other with kindness. 

5. Label the issue by adding comments on the issue. 

	Our triage process requires you to apply labels. Since you are not a Docker
	employee, you can't do this through GitHub. Instead add a comment on the
	issue. GorBot, our very own robot reviews your comment and applies the
	labels for you.

5. Triage another issue.
