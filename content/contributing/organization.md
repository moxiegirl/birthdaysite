Help us organize our work by triaging. Triage is the process of reviewing
incoming issue tickets, gathering more information about the situation, and
verifying whether or not the issue is valid.

You should triage if you want to discover the Docker features other contributors
think is important. Triage is great for contributors that have an interest
or experience in software product management or project management.


# What do you triage?

The Docker projects use GitHub issues to record issues and feature requests that
come in from contributors. Contributors create new issues if they want to:

* report a problem they had with Docker software
* request a new feature 
* ask a question

# How do I triage?

Follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github account</a>.

2. Visit a Docker repository and press the **Watch** button.

	This tells GitHub to notify you of new issues. Depending on your settings,
	notification go to your GitHub or email inbox. Some of repositories you can watch are:

	<table class="tg">
		<tr>
			<td class="tg-031e"><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker" target="_blank">docker/docker</a></td>
			<td class="tg-031e">Docker the open-source application container engine</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="tg-031e"><a href="https://github.com/docker/machine" target="_blank">docker/machine</a></td>
			<td class="tg-031e">Software for the easy and quick creation of Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your own data center.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="tg-031e"><a href="https://github.com/docker/swarm" target="_blank">docker/swarm</a></td>
			<td class="tg-031e">Native clustering for Docker; manage several Docker hosts as a single, virtual host.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="tg-031e"><a href="https://github.com/docker/compose" target="_blank">docker/compose</a></td>
			<td class="tg-031e">Define and run complex applications using one or many interlinked containers.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	&nbsp;
	
	See <a href="https://github.com/docker" target="_blank">the complete list of
	Docker repositories</a> on GitHub.
	
3. Open an issue.

4. Use <a
href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/project/ISSUE-TRIAGE.md"
target="_blank">the triage process</a> to triage an issue. 

5. Triage another issue.


2. Review the issue ticket and reply politely with an appropriate
   response based on the situation. You may need to ask for more
   information, a simplified test case (or a test case at all),
   duplicate the reported behavior using a provided test case (or
   reducing one further), or direct the reporter to the right venue for
   their issue.
3. Apply the right labels by commenting on the issue. GorBot, our very
   own robot will review your comment and apply the labels as necessary.
4. Participate in the discussion as it continues, as necessary.
