# Getting Involved

If you'd like to help us improve the code of any of Docker's projects, we would
love to have your contributions. All of our projects code repositories are on
GitHub. 

Before you do anything else, you ought to sign
up for a free GitHub account if you don't have one already. If you're
comfortable with git and GitHub, you can dive right in by forking a repo,
making some changes, and sending a pull request. 

# Code Contributing Workflow

1. Search for an issue

3. Prepare Your Local Environment
4. Write a Test
5. Fix It
6. Commit and Push It
7. Test It
8. Issue the Pull Request
