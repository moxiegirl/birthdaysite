Documentation is an integral part of any open source project.
Documentation is the common thread that unifies all users, from helping
new users get up to speed to offering detailed explanations of features
for seasoned developers.

# Getting Involved

If you'd like to help us improve the documentation of any of Docker's
projects, we would love to have your contributions. All of our
documentation sites are on GitHub inside of each project. Before you do
anything else, you ought to sign up for a free GitHub account if you
don't have one already. If you're comfortable with git and GitHub, you
can dive right in by forking a repo, making some changes, and sending a
pull request. 

If not, here are some suggestions for getting involved:

# Report an Issue

Perhaps the easiest way to help is to report an issue or problem about
the current documentation. We use GitHub's issue tracker for all of our
documentation sites. Just head on over to one of the following issue
lists to see if your issue has already been reported, and if it hasn't,
give us a detailed rundown of the issue.

# Write or Edit Content

If you actually want to make the fixes and improvements, then you'll
need to fork the repositories you'd like to work on. Once you've made
changes you'd like reviewed for integration, submit a pull request.
However, we recommend that you file issues for new "features" and
significant changes before actually getting to work. For more
information on maintaining your fork and strategies on committing, see
the Commits and Pull Requests guide.

All of the documentation sites use markdown for their documentation.
Familiarizing yourself with Markdown is a good idea in general, and it
would certainly facilitate your contributions to our sites.
