From March 23rd through April 19th, any contributions made to the Docker Project will count toward Dockerâ€™s donation ($50 per contribution) to the Oceanic Society and its mission to conserve the habitat of Moby Dock and blue whales across the planet.

## How to participate

There is no specific date or time for the online event - all you need is a computer and a desire to get involved in open source! To learn more, check out [our presentation created for the birthday week's events](images/presentation.pdf). 

We also have almost all you'll need to start contributing right here! Just see the [Getting Started](./getting-started) on this site.

## Getting help

As with the in-person events, the Docker Project team members and expert developers from the broader open source community will be online to help guide you through contributing. 

## Mentor online
