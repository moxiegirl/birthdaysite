<h1 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h1>

<p>If you have any questions about getting things set up or if you&rsquo;re not
sure about how to address a problem with the code or documentation,
we&rsquo;re here to help.</p>

<h2 id="contributor-support-forum">Contributor Support Forum</h2>

<p>The best place to get help is on the <a href="https://dev.dockerproject.org">Docker contributor
forum</a>. Here the entire community
collaborates and supports each other. There’s even a section for
questions for people new to open source. If you have a question it’s
likely that others either will have it or have had it. By checking the
forum prior to find an answer, then asking a question when you don’t
find the answer you are not only helping yourself, but providing a great
service to the community.</p>

<h2 id="gitter">Gitter</h2>

<p>For people newer to open source, [the gitter
chatroom](https://gitter.im/docker/docker) is easily accessible through
a web browser and authenticates with Github. This channel is dedicated
to contributors new to open source.</p>

<h2 id="irc">IRC</h2>

<p>For people familiar with IRC please join the #docker-dev channel on
Freenode.</p>
